                For my final project, I knew I wanted to use the laser cutter again, and because I also enjoy the vinyl cutter, I also wanted to use this process to complement whatever I laser cut. At first I was just going to make a set of laser cut ornaments with vinyl cut decals but because I wasn't sure about if this would fulfill the movement/interactivity requirement, I made a mini laser-cut journal that would also have decals in addition to the ornaments.

                The preparation for this assignment was pretty easy. I first made the journal cover and the individual ornaments at the scale I wanted them to be at on their own Illustrator files. I wanted the laser engravings to be of Wheaton buildings, so I got some of my own photos and used image trace on them before making ornament/journal cover shape, any additional holes (ex., holes for hanging and that I made in building windows), and lastly the corresponding decal designs on their own individual layers.

                To laser cut the journal covers, I first started by disabling non-relevant layers (ex. reference image and vinyl decal) before importing them into the laser cutting program. For the front cover I didn't do anything very different process-wise, but for the back cover, I just took what I had already imported and just disabled the engraving layer in the laser cutting program so only a blank back cover was cut. I laser cut both covers into wood.

                The process for laser cutting the ornaments was very similar, except for the fact that I wasn't laser cutting them an additional piece like the journal's back cover, and that I laser cut these onto acrylic instead. I did have to run the laser one more time for each ornament on the cutting because cutting just once did not go all the way through the sheet. The acrylic did have the one additional step of having to scrape and pick away the protective plastic and paper left behind after engraving.

                Vinyl cutting the decals was pretty straightforward: I had exported the decal layers from Illustrator as PNGs so I wouldn't have trouble getting an SVG to work the day of. I emailed the PNGs to myself and vinyl cut the ornament decals on silver and gold metallic sign vinyl and cut the journal decal on hot pink.

                To finish the ornaments once I cleaned up the residual paper and plastic on the engraved parts, I just transferred the vinyl decals to their respective ornaments and gave them each a string for hanging.

                Finishing the journal was a little more complicated. First I transferred the vinyl decal to the front cover, which was a little harder than it was for the ornaments just because the individual decal parts were so small. I then cut regular unlined notecards out to fit the shape and size of the journal, then cut holes in them to correspond with the holes in the front cover. I bound all of the pages and covers together with pieces of the same kind of string I'd used for the ornaments earlier.

                And that is how I did my final project! Here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bYji9k337uf1nzg-NyaK6_9_-TBX7II7/view?usp=sharing) is a video of me opening the journal, you can also get a good idea of the size of it here and it's relatively small but I intended it to be something pocket-sized.
