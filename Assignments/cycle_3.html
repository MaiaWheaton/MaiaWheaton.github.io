                For this assignment, we used Illustrator again, this time to use our design for the vinyl cutter to make it into sign and apparel designs.

                I wanted to make my design of two differently colored flowers. When designing it I had one flower pink and the other yellow to reflect what I wanted the final product to look like and to keep track of them, but I later changed it to black and white to make it easier to use with the vinyl cutting software. I kept each flower on their own layer the whole time so that I could make them two different colors.

                When it came time to cut them, I had some trouble because for some reason as an SVG the software would not read some of the petals. I imported them as PNGs instead and this worked better for my purposes. I resized them slightly larger then cut them. It was slightly tough to weed the designs just because of the small parts but it ended up going alright. After weeding I put the sticker onto the sticker paper to attach and I chose a shirt and got ready to use the heat press to apply the apparel version.

                Here are the final products! The apparel vinyl went on a long sleeve green shirt and the sticker vinyl went on my planner.
