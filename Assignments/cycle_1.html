                Finally, don't forget the descriptions like this that just consist of text without an image. Remember, creating a good-looking website is a balancing act. If you use a layout that has an image on the left, your next step should have the image on the right. Keep alternating sides for the best look :)

                In this cycle, we used Adobe Illustrator to create a design as a vector that we would turn into a puzzle with the Epilog laser cutter. The design would have to be in two parts, one which would tell the laser cutter where to cut the individual pieces and the border apart as well another design which designates where the design to be engraved is.

                I decided that I would make my design to correspond to the shapes of the pieces. I made my design so it would look like a little town with interlocking buildings, with the pieces being cut out along the edges of each of the buildings. I also put the silhouettes of some of my pets in the windows of the buildings to make it more personalized.
