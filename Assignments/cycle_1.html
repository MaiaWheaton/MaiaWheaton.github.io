                In this cycle, we used Adobe Illustrator to create a design as a vector that we would turn into a puzzle with the Epilog laser cutter. The design would have to be in two parts, one which would tell the laser cutter where to cut the individual pieces and the border apart as well another design which designates where the design to be engraved is.            </p>

                I decided that I would make my design to correspond to the shapes of the pieces. I made my design so it would look like a little town with interlocking buildings, with the pieces being cut out along the edges of each of the buildings. I also put the silhouettes of some of my pets in the windows of the buildings to make it more personalized.

                To prepare to engrave and cut my puzzle, I put everything to be cut into pieces on one layer in Illustrator and everything to be engraved on a separate one. When I engraved, I first sized down the puzzle then set it up. Here is a photo of the laser cutter in action! Nothing abnormally smoked or caught fire while I was cutting and the whole puzzle took a little under 15 minutes.
