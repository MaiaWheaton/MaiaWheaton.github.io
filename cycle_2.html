                For this assignment, we had to create a small container using 3D modeling software Fusion 360 to be printed on the 3D printers in the fab lab. The container had to be made to fit a specific object of my choice, and I chose my colored pencils.

                This is the pencil box I made in the software Fusion 360. I measured the length and diameter of a pencil to see how large the box and the spaces inside for the pencils needed to be. I started out with the base long rectangle and for the main box I mainly extruded or cut away as needed to ultimately make a pencil box with the spaces for pencils and the place for a lid to fit -- the three sides where a top portion of the box is slightly extruded inwards. I made the lid a separate rectangular piece. I made the lid based on how big it had to be to just fit in the box in the area I made for it without affecting how the pencils would fit in the box.

                Other than importing the lid and the box separately and making some slight adjustments because of the size of the box there wasn't much extra preparation I had to do in Prusa SLicer. The print started off pretty well but because of the size of the box it would be printing overnight, so I'd have to come back to check the following day to see if it came out ok.

                Here is the finished box a day or two later! I had to clean it up a little afterwards, it overall came out like I expected.
